# CRAMML (CRAppy Matrix Multiplication Library)

Too lazy to write the documentation for this stupid library,
if you really want to use this crap read the god damn source code.

If it didn't work or the calculations were wrong for some reason
that's because I didn't even test it at the time of writing this.
